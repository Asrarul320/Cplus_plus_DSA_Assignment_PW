// 5= Is the following program snippet correct?
// int a = 10, b = 20;
// int *ptr;
// *ptr = 5;




// The program is correct and will compile but might result in runtime error.This is
// because ptr will have a garbage address which might even point to a location which
// does not belong to our program and hence might result in Segmentation Fault when we
// are trying to access it.
